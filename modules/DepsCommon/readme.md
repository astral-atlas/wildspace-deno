# Deps Common

A set of commonly-versioned dependencies that multiple
modules may use to help avoid duplicate declarations.

These deps should be both isomorphic and useful for browser
and node/deno based environments.

## Usage

```ts
import { hash, nanoid, rxjs } from '../DepsCommon/mod.ts';
```

## Exports

::deptable
