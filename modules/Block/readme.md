# Block

Data submission & retrieval service for external bytes - 
aka the service that returns audio, textures,
videos, 3d models and other files that are used
(but not internal to) wildspace.

## User Interactions

While users commonly upload files for usage here,
often they don't do so directly - typically they'll
be uploading data via another service. This service
will define a "reference" to the block, keeping
it "alive".

## Usage References

Each "block" of data requires at least one "reference" - 
one is required when the data is created, and additional
reference can be created over the block's lifetime.
